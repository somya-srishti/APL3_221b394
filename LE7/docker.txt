DOCKER

DOCKER DESKTOP 
- Docker is primarily build to be used on LINUX system, to use it on a UNIX system (MacOS) or on windows we need to work on docker desktop.

DOCKER VS VIRTUAL MACHINE
- Docker is a delusion that we are working on ubuntu ( Linux ) but we are not actually, hence docker provides for this virtualisation at the only application layer and hence it is lightweight.
- VM on the other hand work on both application and OS Kernel, i.e. both application layer and Kernel layer is in use and hence it creates its own resources and is heavy.

COMMANDS TO PUSH
- docker pull hello_world
- docker run hello_world
- docker run -it ubuntu
- exit
- docker stop<id>

DOCKER IMAGES(where instructions are written)
To run docker images we need to create its instances these are docker containers

DOCKER NETWORK COMMANDS
- Suppose there are two containers which we want to interact without hassle. [mongo, mongo-express]
- docker network ls
- docker network create mongo-network
- docker network ls
- docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongo --network mongo-network -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME = admin -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD = admin mongo
- docker network inspect mongo-network

- docker run -d -p 8081:8081 --name mongo-express --network mongo-network -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME = admin -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_URL = "mongodb://admin:admin@mongo:27017" mongo-express
